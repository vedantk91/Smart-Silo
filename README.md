# Smart Silo

## Short Description

The Smart Silo project represents a cutting-edge IoT-based storage system designed specifically for the long-term preservation of onions. Utilizing a combination of automatic shuffling mechanisms and regulated ventilation, Smart Silo maintains optimal pressure and humidity levels to prevent rot, thereby extending the storage life of onions. The entire system is controlled and monitored remotely via an app, thanks to Firebase integration, and is crafted to be cost-effective and maintenance-friendly.

## Features

- **Automatic Shuffling Mechanism**: Increases the life expectancy of the onions by 30% by periodically moving them to reduce pressure points.
- **Ventilation Control**: Integrated fans are controlled based on real-time data to maintain the ideal air quality and humidity.
- **Sensor Integration**: Incorporation of temperature and air quality sensors for data acquisition and environmental monitoring.
- **IoT Connectivity**: Utilizes Firebase to facilitate remote monitoring and control, offering convenience and real-time data analytics.
- **App Integration**: A user-friendly interface created with MIT App Inventor, allowing for easy system management from any location.
- **Firmware Development**: Custom firmware written in C++ for efficient data handling and cloud communication over WiFi.
- **Energy Efficient**: Designed to cut maintenance costs by 80%, ensuring an economically sustainable solution.
